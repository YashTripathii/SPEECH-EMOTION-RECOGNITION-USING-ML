Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) Project

This repository contains the implementation of a state-of-the-art Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system, leveraging advanced deep learning techniques to accurately discern emotions from speech signals. The project encompasses a comprehensive pipeline, from data preprocessing and feature extraction to model training and evaluation.

Overview
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a burgeoning field at the intersection of signal processing, machine learning, and affective computing. This project aims to develop a robust and scalable SER system capable of accurately recognizing emotions from speech signals.

Key Features
Dataset Splitting: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Feature Extraction: Extract a comprehensive set of features from audio signals, including MFCCs, energy, and spectral attributes.
Machine Learning Model: Utilize a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture for emotion classification.
Training Procedure: Train the model using the Adam optimizer with a categorical cross-entropy loss function, monitoring accuracy and loss metrics to prevent overfitting.
Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, complemented by confusion matrices for visualization.
